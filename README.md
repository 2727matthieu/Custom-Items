# Custom-Items
Work in progress plug-in for minecraft that can add custom items with an editor.


This project is work in progress, so the features are still very limited.


This repository has 3 java projects: The API, BasePlugin and Editor.
The API is the code that is used by both BasePlugin and Editor.
The BasePlugin is the code for the actual plug-in.
The Editor is the code for the editor users need to use to create their item sets.

Both Editor and BasePlugin rely on github.com/knokko/BitHelper

BasePlugin also relies on github.com/knokko/Core-Plugin-1.12.2
