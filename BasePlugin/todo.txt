Long term:
-Work on automated testing
-Replace minecrafts enchanting and anvil system

Short term:
-Look into sentinel
-Add possibility to manage item flags (and look at the custom unbreakable 'flag')
-Add an option to choose how much damage items will take from hitting enemies and breaking blocks
-Allow using multiple item sets at the same time (enables easy reusing of item sets)
